= FlickRaw-test

This is just a really basic application that uses FlickRaw to call Flickr API and fetch a user's photos after having authenticated him.
I pushed this here for an issue I created on FlickRaw...


== Requirements
To get the app working you need one User in your database, so just run rake db:seed or create a User (with nil token attribute) before running the app.
